# This is the production image to be used in the SUMMA platform The
# ASR Engine is built in a separate container and packaged as a *.deb
# file for easier transfer to this image. We use the multi-stage
# build to reduce the size of the production image; there's no need
# to keep around the build residue.

# TO TRY at some point:
# - use an alpine image instead of Ubuntu for smaller iamge size
# - use apt-get install lib-openblas-dev instead of compiling
#   openblas from scratch in the builder image
